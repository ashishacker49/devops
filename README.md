This is my First file from Ubuntu for Learning Devops

git add -> staging 

git commit -> commited on local repo
git status -> check the changes  
git push -> pushed on remote server


git remote origin 


git scheckout branchname 

git checkout -b branchname 

 new 

 git pull -r (rebase to remove merge conflict if other person also changed anything)
 git push


 .gitignore -> all files which not needed to be shared so create a .gitignore file and add all files name

 git rm -r --cached fileName  ( if already file was added to remote bt now we added it in gitignore file)
